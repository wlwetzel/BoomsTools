## usage of plaintextConverter.py
  Create a folder in which you want to have the data in plaintext written, change the variable baseFolder at the top of the script, then run
  ```
  python3 plaintextConverter.py /path/to/flightComputerData.bin
  ```
  This should create subdirectories with various data from the BOOMS flight in plaintext.
